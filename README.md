# voiceover
VoiceOver is a library for acoustic false-feedback library. It is used to present a stranger's voice in synchrony with the user's speech. It was developed as part of the [ActiveVoice Project] (http://www.activeself.de/active-voice-the-influence-of-dynamic-extralinguistic-and-acoustic-spatial-cues-on-voice-self-ownership/).

It depends on [RtAudio] (https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio) for real-time audio input/output and [libsndfile] (https://libsndfile.github.io/libsndfile/) to read and write audiofiles.
